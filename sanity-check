# Run a sanity check on default lists -- we need to catch things
# like kate and kwrite going missing from the available options
# because their desktop file was renamed (kate.desktop/kwrite.desktop
# in KDE4 vs. org.kde.kate.desktop/org.kde.kwrite.desktop in Plasma 5)
# in a more automated way.
#
# We can't fully automate the check because that would mean adding
# build dependencies on anything we want to list in defaults lists to
# shared-mime-info -- including stuff that lives in contrib, restricted
# or non-free.
#
# But let's give packagers a tool to make spotting mistakes easier...
# (A failure doesn't necessarily mean there's something wrong with
# the file -- it just means it should be double-checked).
